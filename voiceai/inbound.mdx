<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Inbound Numbers">
    Navigate to the Inbound Call page, a dedicated section for managing inbound call configurations. Here, you can assign specific phone numbers to agents. Whenever someone calls that number, the assigned agent will handle the call based on the configured prompt and knowledge base. This page provides a clear and focused interface for managing all inbound call settings.

  <Step title="Customize Outbound Caller ID">
 On the Send Call page, you have the option to select a From Phone Number. Choose a specific number to display as the caller ID, or let the platform handle it with a random number. This flexibility ensures your outbound calls align with your branding or operational requirements.
