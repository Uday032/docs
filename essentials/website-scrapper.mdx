## Website Scraper Integrations

### Extract Cards

**Extract Cards** allow users to extract specific sections, such as product cards or user profiles, from websites and transfer the data to **Google Sheets** or **Docs** for analysis or reporting.

#### Example:

Scrape product listings from a competitorâ€™s site to track their prices or availability.

```
{
    "Authorization": "CLAUD_API_KEY",
    "encrypted_key": "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_KEY"
}
```

### Bulk Scrape

**Bulk Scrape** enables users to perform bulk scraping tasks to collect large amounts of data from multiple websites simultaneously. The extracted data can be utilized for competitive analysis, research, or marketing purposes.

#### Example:

Scrape blog articles or reviews from various websites and compile the data into a **Google Sheet** for keyword analysis.

```
{
    "Authorization": "CLAUD_API_KEY",
    "encrypted_key": "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_KEY"
