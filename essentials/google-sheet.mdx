  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate the Google Sheet Account">
 If you log in using your Google account, the app automatically gains access to your Google Sheets, allowing you to add or retrieve data without any further integration steps. However, if you log in using an email and password (non-Google login), you will need to manually connect your Google account by going to the account settings or integration section to grant the necessary permissions for managing your Google Sheets.

## Google Sheets Integrations Models

### Add Data to Sheet

Automates the process of adding data into **Google Sheets**. This can be used to populate sheets with form submissions, extracted web data, or analyzed results from other nodes.

#### Example:

Data from a website scraper can be directly added to a Google Sheet for tracking product information or leads.

```
{
    "Authorization": "CLAUD_API_KEY",
    "encrypted_key": "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_KEY"
}
```

---

### Get Sheet

Fetch and read data from **Google Sheets**, enabling workflows to use this information for other automated tasks like generating reports or updating documents.

#### Example:

Pull sales data from a Google Sheet and use it to generate automatic monthly reports.

```
{
    "Authorization": "CLAUD_API_KEY",
    "encrypted_key": "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_KEY"
}
```

  </Step>
   <Step title="Run the Node">
 Finally, run the node by executing the required commands or scripts. This will activate the selected model, allowing you to either add new data to your Google Sheet or fetch existing data efficiently.
