  <Step title="Integrate the Google Docs Account">
 If you log in using your Google account, the app will automatically gain access to your Google Docs, allowing you to manage your documents without further setup. However, if you log in with an email and password (non-Google login), you will need to manually connect your Google account by going to the account settings or integration section. This step grants the necessary permissions to work with your Google Docs.
