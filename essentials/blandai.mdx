    ### Batch Calls

**Bland AI** can handle batch operations, processing multiple requests in a single workflow. This is particularly useful for large-scale data entry or automating repetitive tasks like updating multiple **Google Sheets** or sending batch emails.

#### Example:

A batch call can update several Google Docs at once or send multiple API requests in a single workflow.

```
{
    "Authorization": "Bland Ai Key",
    "encrypted_key": "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_KEY"
}
```
